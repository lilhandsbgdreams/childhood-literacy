				<h2>What is a "non-proficient reader"?</h2>
			</header>
			<p>When literacy studies refer to "non-proficient readers", they're referring to readers that <b>range anywhere from illiterate to only having basic reading skills.</b> Some of these children can read words and sentence, however they:</p>

                        <li>Don't comprehend what they read</li>
                        <li>Don't think critically about what they read</li>
                        <li>Rarely correct their own reading mistakes</li>
                        <li>Cannot summarize or ask critical questions about a text</li>

				<h2>The statistics show...</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Children entering kindergarten without basic literacy skills are <b> 3 to 4 times more likely to drop out.</b> Children who are still non-proficient by 3rd grade begin to <b>fall futher behind their peers each year</b> as reading is no longer explicitly taught & learning begins to depend on their ability to read independently. These children then become <b>4 times more likely to drop out.</b></p>
                  <p>The cycle of illiteracy continues in homes where low literacy adults are less likely to share reading with their children.</p>

				<h2>What can we do?</h2>
			</header>
			<p>First, we must understand that reading is not instinctive. Our brains must be taught extra steps to turn symbols into meaningful communication. <b>Reading must be fostered in children through modeling and guidance.</b></p>

                  <p>I hope that you can now share with others the importance and simplicity of promoting literacy at home. If this becomes common knowledge, hopefully we can all help to fight illiteracy.</p>
