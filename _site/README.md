# Childhood Literacy: At home and at large

This educational website seeks to help visitors understand and promote childhood
literacy. It is this author's hope that if this becomes common knowledge, we
can all help to fight illiteracy.

The page:
* Defines what makes a "non-proficient reader".
* Provides some recent statistical snapshots of the impact of childhood literacy.
* Offers visitors ideas and methods they can practice and/or share to promote literacy.

Just a fun little single pager I whipped up to test out my new scroll events plugin
(github.com/ajlkn/jquery.scrollex). Clean, simple, fully responsive, and loaded with
all the usual pre-styled elements. Enjoy :)
